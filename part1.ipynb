    "In my role as a food service supervisor on a college campus, I need to understand student eating habits. I have decision making capacity both on individual recipes and on menu build. There are two main goals in mind related to this. One is to offer healthy items that students will actually choose and enjoy. The second is to provide menus that students will choose over non-campus venues. If we can accurately predict what students will eat and have a good understanding of why, we can tailor our menus to meet both requirements as much as possible. This study whose data I am using was not done on my particular campus, but after working with this data, I hope to be able to collect and analyze similar data for current students NC State.  "

I want to discover if and which of these variables carries the most weight in predicting. I need for the accuracy to be 95% or above in order to use this model for business purposes. There is a risk that, since students are self reporting most of this information, including the target column, any desicions made on what to change on a menu based on this data set may still not meet the goals.
